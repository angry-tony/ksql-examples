- This docker-based setup includes:
    - zookeeper
    - openldap
    - kafka with MDS, connected to the openLDAP
    - schema registry
    - ksql
    - connect
    - rest proxy
    - C3
- You can use production or pre-production images. This is configured via environment variables `PREFIX` and `TAG`. 
    - `PREFIX` is appended before the actual image name, before `/`
    - `TAG` is a docker tag, appended after the `:`
    - E.g. with `PREFIX=confluentinc` and `TAG=5.3.0`, kafka will use the following image: `confluentinc/cp-server:5.3.0`
    - If these variables are not set in the shell, they will be read from the `.env` file. Shell variables override whatever is set in the `.env` file
    - You can also edit `.env` file directly
    - This means all images would use the same tag and prefix. If you need to customize this behavior, edit the `docker-compose.yml` file
- To start confluent platform, run `./confluent-start.sh [project-name]` - where `project-name` is optional name of docker-compose project (-p flag), defaults to `rbac`
    - This creates a docker-compose project called `[project-name]` (or `rbac`)
    - Now you can use standard docker-compose commands like this: `docker-compose -p [project-name] ps` or `docker-compose -p [project-name] logs --t 200 -f control-center`
    - The script will print you cluster ids to use in assigning role bindings
- Kafka broker is available at `localhost:9094` (note, not 9092)
- OpenLDAP is `localhost:389`
- All other services are at localhost with standard ports (e.g. C3 is 9021 etc)
- Login to CLI as `professor:professor` as a super user to grant initial role bindings
- User `bender:bender` doesn't have any role bindings set up and can be used as a user under test
    - You can use `./client-configs/bender.properties` file to authenticate as `bender` from kafka console commands (like `kafka-console-producer`, `kafka-console-consumer`, `kafka-topics` and the like)
    - This file is also mounted into broker docker container, so you can `docker-compose -p [project-name] exec broker /bin/bash` to open bash on broker and then use console commands with `/etc/client-configs/bender.properties`
    - When running console commands from inside the broker container, use `localhost:9092`
- All users have password which is the same as their user name, except `amy`. Her password I don't know, but it isn't `amy` :). So I usually connect to OpenLDAP via Apache Directory Studio and change her password to `amy`. Then use her as a second user under test.
