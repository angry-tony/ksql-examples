- This docker-based setup includes:
    - zookeeper
    - openldap
    - kafka with MDS, connected to the openLDAP
    - schema registry
    - ksql
    - connect
    - rest proxy
    - C3
- First, pull docker images via `./pull-docker-images.sh [tag]` - if testing 5.3, use `5.3.x-latest` as a tag
- This will pull all confluent platform docker images and tag them as `confluentinc/<image>:sanity`
- Then start confluent platform via `./confluent-start.sh [project-name]` where `project-name` is optional name of docker-compose project (-p flag), defaults to `rbac`
- This creates a docker-compose project called `[project-name]` (or `rbac`)
- Now you can use standard docker-compose commands like this: `docker-compose -p [project-name] ps` or `docker-compose -p [project-name] logs --t 200 -f control-center`
- The script will print you cluster ids to use in assigning role bindings
- Kafka broker is available at `localhost:9094`
- OpenLDAP is `localhost:389`
- All other services are at localhost with standard ports (e.g. C3 is 9091 etc)
- Login to CLI as `professor:professor` as a super user to grant initial role bindings
- User `bender:bender` doesn't have any role bindings set up and can be used as a user under test
- All users have password which is the same as their user name, except `amy`. Her password I don't know, so I usually connect to OpenLDAP via Apache Directory Studio and change her password to `amy`. Then use her as a second user under test.
